        <h1>Tech Squad Main Page</h1>
        <p>The tech Squad is a group of students who are in charge of Chromebook 
            repair for Mayfield High School. The group of individuals are also in a 
            class where they will learn a variety of technology related skills. The 
            ultimate goal for anyone in the squad is to service the community and 
            learn enough about technology that they can seem like a wizard among peers.</p>
